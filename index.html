                                    <strong>We believe the Bible</strong> to be the inspired and only infallible written word of God. We believe that there is One God, eternally existent in three Persons; God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit.<br/>
                                    <strong>We believe in the Blessed Hope</strong>, which is the rapture of the church of God, which is in Christ, at His return.<br/>
                                    <strong>We believe that the only means of being cleansed from sin</strong> is through repentance, faith in the precious Blood of Jesus Christ.<br/>
                                    <strong>We believe that regeneration by the Holy Ghost</strong> is absolutely essential for personal salvation.<br/>
                                    <strong>We believe that the redemptive work of Christ on the Cross </strong>provides healing for the human body in answer to believing in prayer.<br/>
                                    <strong>We believe that the baptism in the Holy Ghost</strong>, according to Acts 2:4, is given to believers who ask for it.<br/>
                                    <strong>We believe in the sanctifying power of the Holy Spirit</strong>, by whose indwelling, the Christian is enabled to live a holy and separated life in this present world.

The ministry was to be called the LIFE Church (John 10:10b “I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.”). Without any outside financial support and without any initial members, Dr. Merritt leased a building in the Candler Park neighborhood and began renovating it. This location, 344 Candler Park Drive, NE, became the birth place of LIFE Church. Dr. Merritt spent many hours in prayer in the building, before any services were held. LIFE began as a house of prayer, and continues to be so today. </p></div>

In August, LIFE closed on the facility, and in September, LIFE moved into its new home. The Father favored the three year old ministry to purchase the 25,000 square foot facility and to obtain a mortgage for over $1 Million. The entire time LIFE leased the property in Candler Park, it remained an active listing on the MLS for sell, but there was not a single contract placed on the property, until after LIFE finalized the contract on its new facility. 
                                In January 2016, LIFE officially closed on the property directly across the street from the main campus, and called it LIFE Plaza. This is the second acquisition of LIFE church.</p></div>

Testimonies of healing are prevalent throughout LIFE. Lives are being radically transformed for the better, and to date, the church is growing by leaps and bounds. 8 years later, we are still holding to our original mission "Passionately Loving God and Intentionally Loving People.” </p></div>

While in elementary school, he was labeled a slow-learner. However, after giving his life to the Lord, he began excelling academically and was placed in the class for the gifted in the fifth grade.

                        He became the first black valedictorian of his 50-year-old high school and was named the top graduating male in all 14 high schools of Pinellas County. The recipient of a full academic scholarship to attend Morehouse College in Atlanta, he graduated Phi Beta Kappa, Magna Cum Laude. 
                        ​Dr. Merritt pursued a career in medicine at the prestigious Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore, Maryland, also on a full academic scholarship. After extensive clinical work in the field of Psychiatry, he graduated with a Doctorate in Medicine. He was employed for several years in medical management of one the nation’s largest pharmaceutical companies. <br/>
                        ​Dr. Merritt grew up attending Pentecostal Temple Church of God in Christ (COGIC) in St. Petersburg with his family. He accepted the call to the ministry while at Morehouse College. During his freshman year, he began “Abundant LIFE,” a Bible study for Morehouse and Spelman students. Many students were introduced to the Lord; several of which are in ministry today. Dr. Merritt was later ordained in the COGIC, while in medical school. An anointed and gifted teacher/preacher, he has ministered nationally and internationally in churches and in conferences, as well as conducted health awareness seminars. <br/>
                        For eight years, Dr. Merritt served the Church of God in Christ in the Jurisdiction of Brazil as Superintendent of the Fifth District, under the leadership of the late Bishop Samuel Moore. There, he oversaw the growth and expansion of the church in north Brazil. Under his leadership, the oldest church in the district was purchased, and eight new ministries were birthed. In January 2010, Dr. Merritt established LIFE Church in the Candler Park Neighborhood of Atlanta, Georgia by leading weekly Wednesday evening Bible Study. Sunday Services commenced shortly thereafter in February. God has tremendously blessed and favored LIFE. Ministries encompassing teen mentorship, prison ministry, food and clothing for the needy and benevolent assistance in the community. In August of 2013, LIFE Church made its first acquisition. The then three year old ministry purchased a 25,000 square foot facility in Southwest Atlanta. LIFE Church has taken in more than 1000 members in the past eight years. Lives are being radically transformed for the better. LIFE Church has truly become a place where “miracles are common”.<br/>
​                        In addition to his pastoral responsibilities, Dr. Merritt serves in    
                        the Jurisdiction of North Central Georgia of the COGIC as an Administrative Assistant to Bishop Joseph Hogan and as a District Superintendent over the Zoe District. In recognition and honor of the unique contributions Dr. Merritt has made in ministry, he was inducted into the prestigious MLK Board of Preachers of Morehouse College; and in 2016, he received the prestigious LIFEtime Achievement Award from President Barack Obama.
